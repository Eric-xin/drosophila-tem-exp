v1 analysis.py
- Initial version of the analysis script.
- Basic functionality to load allele counts and process FlyBase lookups.
- Implemented functions to reformat location strings and fetch FlyBase records.
- Added functionality to calculate allele count averages per temperature group.

v2 analysis_v2.py
- Improved error handling in FlyBase lookup functions.
- Enhanced the processing of location strings and FlyBase records.
- Added functionality to split location data into arm, start, and end.
- Introduced progress tracking with tqdm for row processing.

v2.5 analysis_v2.5.py
- IMPORTANT: Added concurrent processing of rows using ProcessPoolExecutor for better performance. [This accelerated the processing of large datasets by parallelizing the work across multiple CPU cores. works really well with the large datasets I have. wuhoo!]
- Introduced global variables for preloaded databases to be used by worker processes.
- Improved error handling and logging for database loading.
- Enhanced the calculation of overall expression averages per temperature group.
