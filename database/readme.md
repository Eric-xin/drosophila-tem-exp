# Database Directory

This directory contains database files necessary for the analysis of temperature-induced gene expression in Drosophila. The files include reference genomes, gene annotations, and HISAT2 index files.

## Contents

- **Reference Genome**: The reference genome for Drosophila melanogaster.
- **GTF Annotation**: Gene annotation file for Drosophila melanogaster.
- **HISAT2 Index**: Index files for HISAT2 alignment.

## Files

The database files are not included in this repository due to their large size.


## Usage

These files are used in the Sashimi processing workflow to align RNA-seq reads, perform quality control, and generate Sashimi plots. For detailed instructions on how to use these files, refer to the [HISAT2 Alignment Workflow for Drosophila Sashimi Plot](index/index.md) and [Sashimi Workflow](../sashimi/workflow.md) documents.
