# Analysis on Temperature induced Expression of Genes in Drosophila

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and data for analyzing the temperature-induced expression of genes in Drosophila. The analysis includes processing gene expression data, performing statistical analysis, and visualizing the results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/droso.git
    cd droso
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Analysis

To run the analysis scripts, use the following commands:

1. Basic analysis:
    ```sh
    python analysis/analysis.py
    ```

2. Improved analysis with error handling:
    ```sh
    python analysis/analysis_v2.py
    ```

3. Concurrent processing for large datasets:
    ```sh
    python analysis/analysis_v2.5.py
    ```

### Data Explorer

The Data Explorer application allows you to visualize and interact with the gene expression data.

1. Run the Data Explorer (Python version):
    ```sh
    python explorer/explorer_v3.py
    ```

2. Run the Data Explorer (C++ version):
    ```sh
    cd explorer/app
    qmake && make
    ./DataExplorer
    ```

### Directory Details

- **analysis/**: Contains the main analysis scripts and changelog.
- **data/**: Contains raw data files used for analysis.
- **database/**: Contains database files for gene annotations and synonyms.
- **explorer/**: Contains the Data Explorer application for visualizing data.
- **function/**: Contains utility functions used in the analysis.
- **output/**: Contains the output files generated by the analysis scripts.

## Results

The results of the analysis are saved in the `output` directory.

## Release
Latest release is 0.2.5 of data explorer application. It is built using C++ and Qt framework and compiled for MacOS with M series processors. You can compile it for your system by downloading the source code.
